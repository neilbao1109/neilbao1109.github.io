An AI agent is formally defined as a software system or program capable of perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators in pursuit of specific goals. This continuous cycle of perception, reasoning, and action forms the fundamental basis of agency. Unlike traditional software, which follows a rigid set of pre-programmed instructions, an agent possesses a degree of autonomy, allowing it to make decisions and adapt its behavior to achieve its objectives.

The core characteristics that define an AI agent are:

* Autonomy: This is the agent's capacity to operate independently, making decisions and performing tasks without constant human oversight or intervention. An agent is given a goal, and it autonomously determines the steps required to achieve it, a key differentiator from conventional software that merely executes explicit instructions. 

* Proactivity and Goal-Orientation: Agents are not merely passive or reactive entities; they are proactive and goal-driven. Their actions are purposeful, aimed at achieving predefined objectives. This goal-oriented behavior means an agent can take the initiative to move its environment closer to a desired state.

* Reasoning and Planning: A central feature of intelligent agents is their cognitive ability to reason, plan, and strategize. This involves processing perceived information, identifying patterns, drawing logical conclusions, and decomposing a high-level goal into a sequence of executable sub-tasks.

* Learning and Adaptation: More advanced agents possess the ability to learn from their experiences and adapt to dynamic or changing environments. Through mechanisms like machine learning, they can refine their performance over time, becoming more effective and efficient at achieving their goals.

This set of characteristics signifies a fundamental evolution in computing. Traditional systems operate on an instruction-based model: a human programmer provides an explicit, step-by-step procedure, and the computer executes it. The agentic paradigm, however, operates on goal-based delegation. A user or developer provides the agent with a high-level objective, and the agent itself is responsible for the "how"—the planning, task decomposition, and execution. This elevation in abstraction has profound implications for software architecture, necessitating new components like orchestration layers, memory modules, and tool-use APIs that are not central to traditional programming.
